Menu UI Improvements
Added smooth tab transition animations with fade effects.
Added scroll position memory per tab (remembers where you scrolled).
Added tooltip system with hover delay for better UX.
Added config dirty tracking with "Unsaved" indicator.
Added keyboard navigation (1-6 keys for tabs, arrow keys to navigate).
Added double-click to reset sliders to default values.

Dynamic Menu Color System
Menu Color picker in Config tab now changes the entire menu theme in real-time.
All UI elements now use the selected accent color:
Panel borders, headers, and title text
Buttons, checkboxes, sliders, and toggles
Tab backgrounds and indicator lines
Config list items (borders, gear icons, selection dots)
Input fields, dropdowns, and scrollbars
Section title text and separators
Main menu background with accent tint
Navigation bar and REEV logo

Note
The menu maintains its dark aesthetic while adapting to any chosen accent color.
